# CRUD-DJANGO
I developed a Django-based web application with a sleek and user-friendly interface to perform CRUD operations seamlessly. The application allows users to add, update, and delete items while integrating features like selecting a location and downloading the created list in PDF format. The project utilizes Django's default SQLite3 database.
